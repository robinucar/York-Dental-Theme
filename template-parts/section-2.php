      <h2>What are clear aligners for children and how do they work?</h2>


      <p>
        Clear aligners are an alternative treatment to braces for teeth straightening. They
        have been successfully used to treat bite, jaw, and other dental development issues in
        children for a number of years. Dr Mafalda and her team are known for their patience,
        expertise and skill when delivering life-changing clear aligner treatment to children.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early orthodontic assessments can be carried out when your child reaches the age of 5,
        whilst treatment can start once they reach the age of 6.

      <h3>Teeth straightening for children – going beyond happy smiles</h3>

      <p>
        Early intervention to address the position of your child’s teeth and how they erupt can
        have a transformative knock-on effect on their lives in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Addressing issues such as bite, tooth alignment and jaw abnormalities is clinically proven
        to improve breathing and posture, among other pathologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        What’s more, treating these issues early can confront feelings of self-doubt and
        self-confidence your child may develop as a result of living with an abnormal tooth
        position, which is a priceless gift that will keep on giving for years to come.
